## Project status

The plugins are available in an early access mode, we will publish milestones as we work towards a 1.0 release.

Current state:

*Write Journal* implemented with minor details in progress, should work but not production ready
*Snapshot Store* should work but not production ready
*Read Journal* implemented with minor details in progress, should work but not production ready
*Lagom support* should work but not production ready


### Caveats

 * In preview status - not production ready
 * Performance and failure scenario testing has not yet been done
 * Smaller schema changes will likely happen and there will not be any migration tools provided as long as
   project releases are milestones
